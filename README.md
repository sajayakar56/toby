# arya
Discontinued.
A framework for reading Melee memory in the Dolphin emulator as well as sending pad inputs through UNIX Pipes. Made a cool POC where an AI crouched when you got near.

# Features

- Pad input writer that submits inputs through UNIX Pipes

# Setup Instructions
Tested only with Dolphin 5.0-5681
- Enable Netplay Community Settings!
- /MemoryWatcher/MemoryWatcher (run mkfifo MemoryWatcher here)
- Put Locations.txt -> MemoryWatcher/Locations.txt
- Create Pipes/arya (mkfifo arya)
